# Welcome
This is the Minecraft Cleanup Tool, also known as mcCleanupWizard on GitHub. Anyone can contribute! To contribute, please check the "Contributions" page (keep scrolling from here).

The latest version is v1 for the tool right now.

# Q&A
"It wouldn't work on my Linux *or MacOS* system": Linux & MacOS are not supported. Only Windows is supported. Please **don't use Wine** to start this on Linux or Mac as it might break things. And, the batch won't work properly (it won't open).

"Which version is it my tool?": Check the version you downloaded and the filename. The latest version is v1 right now.

"Is this file correct?": The file may be corrupted if you download it. Re-download it and try again. Also, **don't download this tool from anywhere else except the GitHub repo here** or any other *contributions made to this project*.

"Can I verify the file is correct using hashes?": Yes, you can. The MD5 for the batch file is: *4081c3a08ef290c4731fcc921eaf1efc* & the MD5 for the executable is *5387ce0ff33a225c56a826844a5e89a5*.

"I got a error when opening the executable.": If you get a error like "Could not open cmd.exe /c cw.bat", the executable may be corrupted. Please verify the file to make sure, or ensure Command Prompt *CMD* is installed on your system.


# Contributions
*This should work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS*

[*Need help?*](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

First, install git. For Linux/MacOS users:
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Windows, Linux, and MacOS users:

Open [this](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page and then click on one of the download pages & install it.

Then, fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com). Then open the forked repo that you have made and click <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infinite0Void/mcCleanupWizard/refs/heads/main/images/githubcodebutton.png"></img> and copy the HTTPS URL that was provided. Then open a terminal and type this:
```bash
git clone "copied-url"
```
Or copy the SSH link (this still works):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/mcCleanupWizard.git
```
HTTPS URL (1st command): Replace *"copied-url"* with the URL you copied. **also make sure to remove the " on both sides**

SSH URL (2nd command): Replace *"username"* with your username and replace *"mcCleanupWizard" (excluding the .git part)* with the repo name (if changed).

Now change the directory to the cloned fork of the repo:
```bash
cd mcCleanupWizard
```
Again, replace *mcCleanupWizard* with your repo name if changed before you cloned it. Now, create a branch:
```bash
git switch -c branch-name
```

Replace *branch-name* with **anything you want**. For example:
```bash
git switch -c add_extra_executables
```

*not finished*
