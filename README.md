# Q&A
"It wouldn't work on my Linux *or MacOS* system": Linux & MacOS are not supported. Only Windows is supported. Please **don't use Wine** to start this on Linux or Mac as it might break things. And, the batch won't work properly (it won't open).

"Which version is it my tool?": Check the version you downloaded and the filename. The latest version is v1 right now.

"Is this file correct?": The file may be corrupted if you download it. Re-download it and try again. Also, **don't download this tool from anywhere else except the GitHub repo here** or any other *contributions made to this project*.

"Can I verify the file is correct using hashes?": Yes, you can. The MD5 for the batch file is: *4081c3a08ef290c4731fcc921eaf1efc* & the MD5 for the executable is *5387ce0ff33a225c56a826844a5e89a5*.

"I got a error when opening the executable.": If you get a error like "Could not open cmd.exe /c cw.bat", the executable may be corrupted. Please verify the file to make sure, or ensure Command Prompt *CMD* is installed on your system.
